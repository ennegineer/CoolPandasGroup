## Navigating our project

 * **APISetup.ipynb** - this file displays the code written to loop over the FBI crime data and merge with Census data. The data is exported to .csv from this notebook to the Data folder.
 * **CrimeRateVsCensusDemographics.ipynb** - this file is the creation of graphs on the crime count vs. population, crime rate per state, and crime rate versus the following: income, poverty, unemployment, education, and veteran rate.
 * **Luan.ipynb** - this file contains links to sources and definitions used within the project. This file contains graphs comparing thefts per district within Orange County to each district's median age.
 * **Tracie_crime_edu_analysis.ipynb** - this file introduces additional data sources used to compare crime rate per state to level of education and graduation rates.

## Project requirements

 * Use Pandas to clean and format datasets
 * Use Jupyter Notebook to describe the data exploration and cleanup process
 * Use Jupyter Notebook to illustrate final data analysis
 * Use matplotlib to create 6-8 visualizations of data (ideally 2 per question asked of data)
 * Save PNG images of visualizations to distribute to the class and for presentation inclusion
 * Use at least 1 API to collect data
 * Create a summary of major findings. Include heading for each question


## Project proposal

 ### Project scenario

 **CPG Consulting will look at crime data and compare it to the Census data to find correlations and answer questions.**
 
 CPG was hired as the consulting group to help the US government look into the crime rate in the US and look for correlations with Census demographics. Looking at crime data from the FBI and the Census Bureau data from 2019, CPG Consulting will look for relationships between crime rate and other factors such as household income, average age, level of education, unemployment rates, and other economic indicators.
 
 These findings will be put into a final report with visualizations to aid the government in assessing what they can do to potentially lower crime rates.
 

 ### Datasets used for analysis

 * FBI Crime Data (documentation: https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/docApi)
 * United States Census Bureau data
 * College completion rates (sourced from https://data.world/databeats/college-completion)


 ### Research questions to answer

  1. Look for correlation between crime rate and income
  2. Find relationship between crime rate and unemployment
  3. Compare crime rate to level of education
  4. Look for correlation between crime rate and average age
  5. Compare crime rate to economic indicators such as amount of new construction per state
 
 
 ### Rough breakdown of tasks
 * Repo manager: Enne
 * PowerPoint manager: Tracie
 * Each teammate will focus on one question and provide graphs to support our conclusions
